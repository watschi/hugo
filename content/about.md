Hi !  
I'm Fabian, 21 years old, from Germany and in the middle of my apprenticeship as a sysadmin. Currently I'm dipping my toes into all the interesting technology that is out there right now, trying to find what is the most interesting and helpful thing I want to work with and develop my future career with.  
Since there is a lot to learn and it is easy to forget I want to write parts of it down here. Hopefully, some of it is gonna be useful for other people that are trying to get started with a piece of software or technology that I'm experimenting with, or facing a similar problem I was able to solve.

> Automate all the things !

One of the first projects I've been working on in my apprenticeship was to automate a pretty tedious patching task with PowerShell. It was my first time writing actual code and i was pretty overwhelmed initially. Although these first pieces of code have been absolutely horrible and the fact that it took me a whole week writing only about 30 of these horrible lines, I quickly realized how awesome automation, CLIs and APIs are.  
Because of this I got into scripting (PowerShell, Bash, Python) and Configuration Management Tools like Ansible and PowerShell's Desired State Configuration. I also like to fiddle around with self-hosted services in my "homelab" environment and a free-tier aws instance (this blog for example).
