      <description>Dynamic Parameters for your PowerShell Cmdlets One of the things I love about PowerShell is its great tab completion. Using tab completion often saves you a lot of hassle with typos you may overlook otherwise and in my opinion it eases the discoverability and understanding of many parameters greatly. Seeing possible values for a parameter often makes you understand what it will do before even looking into the documentation.</description>

      <description>Hi !
I&amp;rsquo;m Fabian, 21 years old, from Germany and in the middle of my apprenticeship as a sysadmin. Currently I&amp;rsquo;m dipping my toes into all the interesting technology that is out there right now, trying to find what is the most interesting and helpful thing I want to work with and develop my future career with.
Since there is a lot to learn and it is easy to forget I want to write parts of it down here.</description>
